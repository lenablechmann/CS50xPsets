We need to write a cipher that shifts letters.

First we shouldnt be using main void, instead it should be using command line arguments.

The only argument it should accept is a positive integer and if it doesnt get a positive integer
it should prompt for a key
use int isdigit(int c) and strlen

once it has a key it should ask for a text line

probably via get string

then this string should be dealt with as tho it is an aarray of characters

then we will add the number so that it cycles through the alphabet using ci = (pi + k) % 26

upper cases and lower cases should be handles separately
and if there is a non letter it should be printed as is.
