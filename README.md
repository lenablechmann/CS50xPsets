A collection of problem sets I've done throughout 2020 following the amazing [CS50x](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/ "CS50 course") course.

### Problem Set 2
This problem set focuses on arrays in **C**.
- **Readability** is a C program, that computes the approximate grade level needed to comprehend some text.
- **Caesar** a program that encrypts messages using Caesarâ€™s cipher.

### Problem Set 3
PSet3 focuses on basic algorithms in **C** like binary search.
- **Plurality** is a program that runs a plurality election.
- **Runoff** a runoff style election.

### Problem Set 4
PSet4 tackles memory allocation in **C**, (stack, malloc, free, pointers) 
- **Filter** implements different image filters (opens image files, then runs them through either grayscale, sepia, mirror or blur filter depending on user choices.)
- **Recover** recovers JPEGs from a forensic image using JPEG signatures

### Problem Set 5
PSet5 goes over some data structures in **C**: singly linked lists, tries, hash tables.
- **Speller**  spell-checks a file using and checking its hashed words vs a dictionary which is stored into hash table.

### Problem Set 6
Introduction to **Python**. 
- Reimplementation of very basic C exercises but in Python (hello world, mario, cash).
- Reimplementation of pset2 (readability) in Python.
- **DNA** a program that identifies a person based on their DNA. DNA db with people name and sequence frequences is stored as a CSV file, which is called and parsed via Python, the DNA sequence is stored in a text file.

## Problem Set 7 
Introduction to **SQL**ite and how to access it with **Python**
- **Movies** is a selection of 13 SQL-Query based exercises which are ran on the image movie database compy in SQLite
- **Houses** imports student data with Python into a SQLite database, and then produce class rosters.

## Problem Set 8
Web Track is an introduction to full stack web applications using **HTML**, **CSS**(bootstrap), **Javascript** frontend and **Python(Flask)** + **SQLite** backend
- **Homepage** is a basic personal homepage mockup with HTML, bootstrap and Javascript
- **Finance** is a web application that allows users to "buy" and "sell" stocks. Uses calls to API to determine the current price of the stock. Users can log in and their trading history/transactions are saved in a SQLite DB. The app uses the MVC pattern.
